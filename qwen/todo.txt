now:








History:


-----------

Change for qwen_controller.py.

1. Plz now bid in 6 min not 5, 
2. Cfg now in 1-6. 


And now only focus on the scip solver thx.


This is a pipeline, but now somehting can be consistently changed, so plz move some consistently changed content out, u can make ur implemented codes as a python package, 

The changed part is

The prompts, 

And 

How the information of logs should be processed since the logs are too long I cannot pass them all into the conversation, but only some snippets..

So the codes for dealing with this should be placed into a py code, while others should be kept in other py files, plz do not make them too long, but use different files and make them a fixed python package, one file do thing, plz stick to this rule, thx.
